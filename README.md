Tridactyl theme based on the [base16 gruvbox theme](https://github.com/bezmi/base16-tridactyl) by Bezmi which uses [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) by Chris Kempson.

The biggest change is that I positioned the command bar at the bottom like the default theme and styled it a bit to make it more CLI-like. 
I couldn't find any gruvbox themes that had this and I just think it looks cooler.
